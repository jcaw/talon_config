# Talon Config

This is my personal Talon config. It's not really designed for general consumption, but it's provided openly in case people find it useful as a reference.

I built this config for myself - it's not based on knausj. It's very different from knausj and other configs out there. It's fairly extensive, so there are likely things that could be lifted and used in the more popular configs.
